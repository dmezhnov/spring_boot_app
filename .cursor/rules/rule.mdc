# Rule files overview

- `rule.mdc`: root/meta rule file that describes the rule layout and applies globally.
- `project.rule.mdc`: primary rule file for this repository that defines the main behavioral rules (these are the effective defaults for this project and should normally be reused across other projects as well).
- `*.project.rule.mdc`: additional project-scoped rule modules for specific concerns (for example, `java_fields_only.project.rule.mdc`, `java_interface_impl.project.rule.mdc`).

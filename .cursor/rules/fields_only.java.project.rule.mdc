## Java Field-Only Data Access Rule

In this repository, generating or using getters/setters is prohibited for Java classes defined in this project. Use direct public-field access only for project-owned types. If a future dedicated rule for a specific case (for example, a JPA entity rule) ever allows getters/setters, it must be added explicitly and only after the user confirms that such an exception is acceptable. Calling getters/setters on third-party or framework types (for example, classes from Spring, JPA, or external SDKs) is allowed when it is required by their public APIs.

- MUST:
  - Declare data-carrying fields that are part of external data models (for example, DTOs, request/response objects, and other public API models) as public (`public`). Internal technical or infrastructure fields that are not part of the exposed data model may remain non-public.
  - Access data via fields: `request.name`, `response.status`, etc.
  - Prefer Lombok annotations that do NOT generate getters/setters: `@Builder`, `@NoArgsConstructor`, `@AllArgsConstructor`, `@EqualsAndHashCode`, `@ToString`.
- MUST NOT:
  - Add getters/setters to project classes, either as explicitly declared `getX()/setX()/isX()` methods or via Lombok annotations `@Getter`, `@Setter`, or `@Data`. Other Lombok annotations are allowed unless they are explicitly added to this MUST NOT list in a future revision of this rule, even if they generate getters/setters.
  - Call `getX()/setX()` or `isX()` in controllers, services, or tests for project types; rely on direct field access instead.
- SCOPE:
  - Applies to all Java code in this project (all production and test Java source files, including DTOs, entities, services, helpers, utilities, tests, and any other project-owned types).
  - If future entities or integrations require a different approach for project-owned types (for example, JPA or third-party frameworks), add a dedicated rule that explicitly exempts those specific types or packages.
- MIGRATION:
  - For project-owned types, replace `getX()/setX()` with direct field access `.x`.
  - For booleans in project-owned types, use `.available` instead of `isAvailable()`.
  - Jackson serializes/deserializes public fields of project-owned types out of the box; getters/setters are not required for them.
- REVIEW GATE:
  - Reject changes that add getters/setters or Lombok annotations that generate them.
  - Propose converting to public fields and updating call sites.

Examples

Bad:
```java
@Data
public class UserRequest {
    private String name;
}
// ...
if (req.getName() == null) { /* ... */ }
```

Good:
```java
@Builder
@NoArgsConstructor
@AllArgsConstructor
public class UserRequest {
    public String name;
}
// ...
if (req.name == null) { /* ... */ }
```
